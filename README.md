# AP-Comp-Sci-Quarter3
These are Labs from AP Comp Sci, Quarter 3, in the 2022-2023 school year. You are free to use them for reference, help, or whatever.
These may not line up with your labs! Be sure to cross-reference what your teacher is asking for with the code.
The quarters correspond to the quarter when I was assigned the lab. This may not line up with when you do the lab, depending on how fast your class moves.
If you think a lab is missing, check the other repositories. If you can't find it, I probably did not do it. Sorry :(.
You may download the files and edit the code as needed. I recommend changing file titles that include my last name :). 
Some labs included multiple Java files. In those cases, I only included the files that I wrote code in. Your teacher should provide the rest of the needed files.
I DO NOT ENDORSE USING THESE LABS TO CHEAT. IF YOU DO SO, IT IS WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE AND I BEAR NO RESPONSIBILITY.
